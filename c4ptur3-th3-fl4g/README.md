Ans: Let's make this a bit trickier...
```

## Spectograms

```bash
The downloaded file was analyzed with Audacity. I changed the view to Spectogram which revealed the flag.

The flag is Super Secret Message

```

![Spectogram](./spectogram.png)

## Steganography

```bash
Decode the image to reveal the answer.

We can use steghide to extract the hidden message.


```

## Security through obscurity

```bash
Download and get 'inside' the file. What is the first filename & extension?

In the terminal, type strings meme.jpg.

Ans: hackerchat.png
```

```bash
Get inside the archive and inspect the file carefully. Find the hidden text.

In the terminal, type strings meme.jpg.

Ans: AHH_YOU_FOUND_ME!
